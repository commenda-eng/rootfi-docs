In order to get started using your own credentials for our Wix integration, you will need to first register your Wix application. After that, you will need to enter your Client ID and Client Secret on the RootFi dashboard.

These steps are elaborated on below.

2. On the top right corner, find and click the '+ Create New App' button. This action initiates the creation of your new app.
3. Once your app is created, look for the 'OAuth' option on the sidebar and select it. This section is where you manage your app's OAuth credentials.
