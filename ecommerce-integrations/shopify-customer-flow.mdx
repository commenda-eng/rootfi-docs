To get started with our Shopify integration, your customer must first create an API Key on their Shopify dashboard. Then, they must enter their Shopify credentials on RootFi when prompted during the onboarding flow via SDK or Invite Link.

These steps are elaborated on below.

### Generate Shopify API Key

1. Click the ‘Configurations’ tab for the new app created and click ‘Configure’ on the ‘Admin API integration’ card.
