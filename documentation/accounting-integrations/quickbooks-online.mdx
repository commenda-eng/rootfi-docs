Before you can start pulling data from customers who use QuickBooks Online for their accounting, you will need to set up the QuickBooks Online integration.

There are two integrations available:

1. QuickBooks Online Sandbox (for development and testing)
2. QuickBooks Online (for production)

---

### Overview

In order to set up the integration there are a few steps that must first be completed.

1. Create an app in the [Intuit Developer Portal](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/homepage).
2. Complete the app assessment questionnaire.
3. Once your app is approved you will be able to access your production keys.
4. Add your secure keys to the Integration Labs dashboard and start pulling data!

We will do a detailed breakdown of these steps in the sections below:

### Part 1 - Create your Quickbooks Application

When you create a QuickBooks Online app in the Intuit Developer Portal, you can choose to configure it for the sandbox environment or production environment. The app will have two sets of keys: development and production.

We recommend first configuring your app for the sandbox integration so you can test thoroughly before going live. You can access your dev keys in the Development Settings section of your Quickbooks dashboard.

Perform these actions in the [Intuit Developer Portal](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/homepage).

1. Click on Dashboard from the nav bar at the top of the screen.
2. Select Create an app.
3. Select QuickBooks Online and Payments, and enter your app name.
4. Under Select a scope, choose com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting.
5. Click Create app.
6. Configure the app to connect to the sandbox environment:
   1. In the left menu, click on Development Settings > Keys & credentials.
   2. In the Redirect URIs section, select 'Add URI'.
   3. In the 'Link' box on top, enter the Integration Labs URI: `https://integrate.Integration Labs.dev/oauth/callback`
7. Then click Save.
8. Your development keys (client ID and client secret) will be displayed in the 'Keys' section at the top of the page.
9. Copy these keys and simply paste them into the Quickbooks Sandbox integration on the Integration Labs Platform.

### Part 2 - Completing the App Assessment Questionnaire

1. Select Production Settings > Keys & Credentials, from the nav bar on the left.
2. Then theGet your app's production keys page will come up.
