## Synchronous Writes

Push data to your customers platform seamlessly using a single api

We support the ability to push data to your customers platform in a synchronous and asynchronous manner.

By default our write APIs are synchronous. You can find our APIs in our [Postman Collection](https://postman.Integration Labs.dev) and our [API Reference](/api-reference/accounts/create-accounts).

The Postman has examples for all the different integrations we support as there are several small differences in the fields we support for the various integrations.

You can view these differences in our [coverage tool](https://coverage.Integration Labs.dev).

**Batch Writes**

We also support the ability to write multiple objects of the same type in one request using our Batch Writes Feature.

## Asynchronous Writes

By default our write APIs are synchronous. You can find our APIs in our [Postman Collection](https://postman.Integration Labs.dev) and our [API Reference](/api-reference/accounts/create-accounts).

**To write data asynchronously you need to pass in a query parameter called `async` with a value `true` in the request.**

We will return an `upload_job_id` which you can use to query the status of the write. Alternatively, you can also [configure a webhook](/docs/webhooks) of type "Sync Complete" to receive the status of the write.

The Postman has examples for all the different integrations we support as there are several small differences in the fields we support for the various integrations.

### Batch Writes

To send data as a batch, simply send the `data` as an array of objects.  
We group all the writes in a single `upload_job_id` that is returned in the response.

**Note we only support batch writing data of the same data model**

For example: To write 10 invoices and 10 bills, you can write 10 invoices using our invoices API and then write 10 bills using our bills API. You cannot write 10 invoices and 10 bills using one api.
