### Configuring Sync Config

Here are some important terms:

1.  **Data Model:** The Data Model to which auto sync configuration applies.
2.  **Frequency:** The rate at which the API checks for updates and syncs data with other systems. Options are **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**.
    1. **Daily**: Based on the interval, the data model will be synced in Daily Intervals.
    2. **Weekly**: Based on the interval, the data model will be synced in Weekly Intervals.
    3. **Monthly**: Based on the interval, the data model will be synced in Monthly Intervals.

<Note>If you need to sync data more frequently than daily, please reach out to us via chat or email us at contactus@rootfi.in</Note>

3.  **Access**: The level of access to the data model. Options are **Read Only** and **Read & Write**.

    1.  **Disabled**: The data model will not be synced.
    2.  **Read**: The data model will only be allowed to be synced in Read Only mode.
    3.  **Write**: The data model will only be allowed to be synced in Write Only mode.
    4.  **Read & Write**: The data model will be allowed to be synced in Read & Write mode.

<Info>
Choosing the Appropriate Access level

Based on your Sync Configuration, RootFi will only take the required access level from the integration. If you require a **higher level** of access after a customer has connected their integration, in **most integrations** you can ask the customer to re-authenticate their integration with RootFi. This will grant RootFi the required access level.

</Info>

To learn more about how configuring access levels works for each integration, please refer to the [setup guide for the each integration](/documentation/accounting-integrations/accounting-integrations-overview).

## OAuth Scopes

Scopes are the permissions selected by your end customer to access specific data from their integration platform.

In order to maintain your customersâ€™ data privacy, we use Scopes that allow you to preconfigure access levels for the exact data you need. **The access levels you select will be the scopes we request from the integration platforms.**

When your customers [connect their integration platform to RootFi](/documentation/concepts/rootfi-connect/overview), they will see data models along with the access levels you have chosen above. Upon reviewing the permissions, we will request OAuth scopes of these same permissions from the integration platform. In most cases, the integration platforms clearly outline the scopes that are being given, allowing your customer to once again acknowledge the access level of data sharing consent being given to RootFi.
