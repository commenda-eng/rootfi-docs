RootFi supports white labelling the onboarding process through the Connect SDK. Your end users can create connections to their platforms without using the RootFi dashboard to generate [Invite Links](/documentation/concepts/rootfi-connect/invite-link). We currently offer a Javascript SDK but you can request other frameworks by contacting us.

### Developer Reference

1. Create an invite link by calling the [Create Invite Link API](/api-reference/invite-links/create-invite-link).
   1. If `company_name` is not passed, company wont be created and so, your user will have to enter it in the SDK.
   2. To enable only certain integrations, you can pass a list of `integrations`. If only one integration is passed, user will be redirected to the platform login url directly.
2. The response will contain the `invite_link`, which will need to be sent to the SDK during initialisation, and the `company_id`, which you should store to uniquely identify this customer.

### Setup SDK

1. Import the source script in the head tag. `<script src="https://integrate.rootfi.dev/sdk.js"></script>`
2. Load the RootFi SDK on page load by calling `RootfiLink.initialize()`.

```java JavaScript
RootfiLink.initialize({
    linkToken: "", // invite_link returned from the Create Invite Link API
    onSuccess: () => {
       // Will be called, once connection is successful
    },
    onReady: () => {
       // Will be called once the src script is loaded
    },
    onExit: () => {
       // Will be called when user clicks close button on SDK.
    },
 });
```

1. Call `RootfiLink.openLink();` to open the SDK. Make sure you call this function onReady is called back on initialisation.
2. Call `RootfiLink.closeLink();` to close the SDK. You can use this method to close the SDK in **onSuccess** and **onExit** Callback;

<Warning>The SDK will not close until you call `RootfiLink.closeLink();`</Warning>

Below is a HTML snippet of integrating the SDK

```html HTML
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://integrate.rootfi.dev/sdk.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script>
      const RootfiLink = window.RootfiLink;
      function loadRootFi() {
        RootfiLink.initialize({
          linkToken: "1234567", // invite_link_id returned from Create Invite Link API
          onSuccess: () => {
            // connection succeeded
            RootfiLink.closeLink(); // Close the SDK
            alert("Connection Success");
            // Make an api call to save success status to your  db
          },
          onReady: () => {
            // Open SDK when ready. You can open on a button Click.
            RootfiLink.openLink();
          },
          onExit: () => {
            // Close SDK when user clicks closed.
            RootfiLink.closeLink();
            // Or you can show a alert msg instead of closing iframe
            alert("Please complete the setup");
          },
        });
      }
    </script>
