## Overview of the Invite Link

Our Invite Link allows you to invite customers to authorize data access by delivering an in-browser experience without any frontend code.

The Invite Link is a unique and secure URL that needs to be sent to your end users.

#### Benefits of using the Invite Link:

- Fast proof of concept of Integration Labs without making any frontend changes, such as embedding the Connect SDK into your application
- Your users can authorize integrations without logging into your application i.e sending URLs via email

### Generate Invite Link

An Invite Link can be generated in two ways:

1. From your Integration Labs dashboard (No-code and beginner-friendly)
2. Programmatically via API (Intermediate)

#### Via the Integration Labs Dashboard

You can initialize an Invite Link from the Integration Labs Dashboard in three easy steps.

1. Navigate to Companies in the left navigation
2. On the top right corner of the page, click the Invite a Company button
3. Click Generate URL, and copy the URL

That's it! You will be presented with a unique URL that you can send to your customer.

#### Via API

Refer to our [Invite Link API](/api-reference/v3/core/invite-links/create-invite-link) for more details on how to generate Invite Links programmatically. Using the API, you can customize the behavior of the link, such as only displaying platforms that are relevant to your customer, prefilling the customerâ€™s company name, setting up a custom sync configuration for this connection.

After generating an Invite Link, you can send your customer an invite URL:

Default: https://app.rootfi.dev/onboarding?invite_link_id=INVITE_LINK_ID.

KSA Region: https://app.sa.rootfi.dev/onboarding?invite_link_id=INVITE_LINK_ID.

Alternatively you can use the [Connect SDK](/documentation/concepts/rootfi-connect/embedded-sdk) to embed the onboarding experience in your application.
