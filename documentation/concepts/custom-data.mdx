## Custom Fields

You have the ability to create your own field mapping for any data model to have your own unified schema.

This is an enterprise feature. Contact us to configure your own data mapping across integrations.

## Custom Data Models

For data models that we do not support, you can create any data model supported by the underlying platform. By creating a data model, we handle the pagination, incremental syncing and webhooks just like our unified data models.

This is an enterprise feature. Contact us to configure a custom data model for your integration.
