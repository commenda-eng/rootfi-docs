<Info>
Choosing the Appropriate Access level

Based on your Sync Configuration, RootFi will only take the required access level from the integration. If you require a **higher level** of access after a customer has connected their integration, in **most integrations** you can ask the customer to re-authenticate their integration with RootFi. This will grant RootFi the required access level.

</Info>

To learn more about how configuring access levels works for each integration, please refer to the respective integration documentation.

To understand the importance of access levels, please refer to the [Scopes](/documentation/concepts/scopes) section.
