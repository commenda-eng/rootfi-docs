You just need to pass in the correct API config (URL path and method), and we will handle the authentication to call the API for that accounting platform and return the response data.

If you need this passthrough API, would like to learn more about how this works, or need to read or write certain data points, please reach out to us by opening the chat box on the bottom right of our [website](https://www.rootfi.dev/)
