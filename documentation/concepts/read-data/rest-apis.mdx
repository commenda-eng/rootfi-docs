We support easy to use rest apis for all our data models with the following query parameters:

1. **take** - the number of objects you want to retrieve.

   <Note>We support a maximum take of 500 records. The default take is 100.</Note>

2. **skip** - the index from where you want to start retrieving objects
3. **orderBy** - a json string you can pass to sort the data. The orderBy format is the same as the orderBy variable you make when calling the [GraphQL APIs](/documentation/concepts/read-data/graphql-apis). The format is as follows:

   1. **field name** - the name of the field you want to order on. Example: `current_balance`
   2. **sort direction** - the sort direction you want to use to order the data. Values are either `asc` or `desc`. Example: `asc`

   An example of a orderBy json using the Examples above would be: `{"current_balance": "asc"}`

4. **filter** - a json string you can pass to filter the data. The filter format is the same as the filter variable you make when calling the [GraphQL APIs](/documentation/concepts/read-data/graphql-apis). The format is as follows:

   1. **field name** - the name of the field you want to filter on. Example: `rootfi_company_id`
   2. **operator** - the operator you want to use to filter the data Example: `eq`
   3. **value** - the value you want to filter on. Example: `694`

   An example of a filter json using the Examples above would be: `{"rootfi_company_id": {"eq": 694}}`

Our [api reference](/api-reference/accounts/get-all-accounts) shows you how to use these params. Please contact us if you have any questions.

<Note>
    **Highly recommend GraphQL**

    We highly recommend you [use our GraphQL apis](/documentation/concepts/read-data/graphql-apis) to read data. You have a GUI to easily make complex queries to suit your needs. The GraphQL playground also makes it very easy to test your queries and see the results.
