We support the ability to push data to your customers platform in a synchronous and asynchronous manner.

By default our write APIs are synchronous. You can find our APIs in our [Postman Collection](https://postman.rootfi.dev) and our [API Reference](/api-reference/accounts/create-accounts).

The Postman has examples for all the different integrations we support as there are several small differences in the fields we support for the various integrations.

You can view these differences in our [coverage tool](https://coverage.rootfi.dev).
