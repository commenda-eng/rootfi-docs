## Unified APIs

### What are Unified APIs?

A Unified API (Or universal API) aggregates APIs in the same software category like accounting, payments, CRM, and e-commerce. It makes integration with various platforms easier through a standard endpoint, handling authentication, and providing normalized data models.

For example, reading invoice data from an enterprise ERP like Oracle NetSuite will look the same as reading invoice data from an SME focused, on-premsie platform like Tally. Using Integrations by Commenda (formerly RootFi), your solution can leverage the same, normalized set of fields, regardless of the underlying platforms.
