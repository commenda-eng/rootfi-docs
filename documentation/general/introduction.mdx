## What is Integration Labs (formerly RootFi)?

Integration Labs (formerly RootFi) is a data integration platform that makes it easy for companies to connect their apps to their customers' accounting, payments and e-commerce platforms, with more categories soon. We provide a well-documented Unified API that product teams use to read and write data to our growing portfolio of platforms.

Companies use Integration Labs to underwrite credit risk, automate accounting, surface business insights and create new business tools.

Our API saves product teams hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars that would have otherwise been spent building these API integrations in-house.

## Unified APIs

### What are Unified APIs?

A Unified API (Or universal API) aggregates APIs in the same software category like accounting, payments, CRM, and e-commerce. It makes integration with various platforms easier through a standard endpoint, handling authentication, and providing normalized data models.

For example, reading invoice data from an enterprise ERP like Oracle Netsuite will look the same as reading invoice data from an SME focused, on-premsie platform like Tally. Using Integration Labs, your solution can leverage the same, normalized set of fields, regardless of the underlying platforms.
