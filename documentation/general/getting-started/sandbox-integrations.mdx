RootFi offers Sandbox access for some integrations on our Enterprise Plans. If you are interested in testing with RootFi owned sandboxes filled with sample data, please contact us to request access.

The fastest way to get started, is to use our built-in Sandbox Integration (Accounting). You can find it in the “Integrations” section in the RootFi dashboard.

Most platforms offer a free trial that you can use to test out RootFi. Here are all the platforms:

- Zoho Books
- Quickbooks
- Xero
- Wave
- Oodoo

<Note>
We recommend using Quickbooks for testing the Accounting Integration as this platform provides a Sandbox Environment and great Data Model Coverage.

### Enterprise and On-Premise platforms

Enterprise platforms such as Netsuite do not offer free Sandbox access. For customers on our Enterprise plan, we offer access to our instance as well as joint testing sessions.
