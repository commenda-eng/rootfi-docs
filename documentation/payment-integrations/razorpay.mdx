To get started with our Razorpay integration, your customer must first create an API Key on their [Razorpay dashboard.](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/?screen=sign_in) Then, they can enter their Razorpay credentials on RootFi when prompted during the onboarding flow via SDK or Invite Link.

These steps are elaborated on below.
