## Getting Started

Integration Labs provides a set of APIs that allow you to interact with the platform. The APIs are organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
