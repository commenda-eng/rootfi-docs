**The Goods Receipt Notes Data Model** is designed to standardise and simplify the handling of goods receipt notes related information across different accounting platforms.

- Unified goods receipt note properties: The model consolidates essential goods receipt note details, such as delivery date, currency, status, and total amounts, making it easier to manage invoice data from various platforms.
- Linked entities: Goods Receipt Notes can be associated with customers, line items, and purchase orders, providing a complete view of the invoicing process and related transactions.
- Flexible status tracking: The model supports a range of goods receipt note statuses, such as draft, submitted, partially paid, and overdue, for better organisation and reporting.
