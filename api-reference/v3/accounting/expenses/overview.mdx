**The Expenses Data Model** is designed to streamline the management and retrieval of expense-related information across various accounting platforms.

- Unified expense properties: The model unifies essential expense information, including document numbers, posted dates, payment modes, and currency details, facilitating consistent and accurate expense tracking.
- Contact and account relationships: Expenses can be easily linked to specific contacts and accounts using their respective platform IDs, allowing for efficient organisation and reporting.
- Line item support: The inclusion of line items within the expense data model enables more granular and detailed expense management, as well as the ability to track individual components of an expense.
- Currency conversion: The `currency_rate` property supports multi-currency scenarios by providing the conversion rate between the expense currency and the base currency, ensuring accurate financial reporting across various currencies.
