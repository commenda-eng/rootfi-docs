**The Contacts Data Model** simplifies the handling and retrieval of contact-related information across various accounting platforms.

- Unified contact properties: The model unifies essential contact details, such as name, contact person, currency, and tax number, enabling easier access and management of contact data from different platforms.
- Comprehensive contact information: Contacts can include associated data like contact persons, phone numbers, addresses and external links for a more detailed representation of each contact.
- Status tracking: The model supports tracking the status of each contact, with values like `ACTIVE`, `ARCHIVED`, and `UNKNOWN`, facilitating better organisation and reporting.
