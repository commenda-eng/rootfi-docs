- Unified document properties: The model unifies essential document details, such as file name, file type, file size, and platform ID, making it easier to work with documents from different platforms.
- Document type association: Documents can be linked to specific document types (e.g., bills, invoices, expenses) using the `document_type_id` and `document_type` properties, facilitating easy retrieval and organisation of documents.
- File metadata: The model includes file type (MIME Type) and file size properties, enabling developers to handle documents appropriately and ensure compatibility with their applications.
- Document upload status: When you request for a document to be downloaded, RootFi will download the document then cache the document on to its servers so future calls to download the document will be faster. The `document_uploaded` property indicates whether RootFi has uploaded the document to its servers.

<Note>
    **Downloading the Document**

    After initially syncing the documents data `document_uploaded` will be `false` for all the documents. To download the document you must call the [Download Documents API](api-reference/v3/accounting/documents/download-document). This API will download the document and return a temporary `download_url`. Subsequent calls to download the document will be faster as the document will be cached on RootFi's servers.
