- Unified bill payment properties: The model unifies essential core payment details, such as payment date, payment mode, currency, and amount, ensuring consistent access to payment data.
- Associated data linkage: The data model connects bill payments to related information, such as bills, contacts, and accounts, using platform-specific IDs for easy cross-referencing.
- Currency conversion support: The `currency_rate` property provides the exchange rate between the payment currency and the base currency, facilitating multi-currency payment handling and reporting.
