**The Bills Data Model** is designed to simplify the handling and retrieval of bill-related information across various accounting platforms.

- Unified bill properties: The model unifies essential bill information such as vendor, account, dates, currency, and amounts, enabling a unified view of bills from different platforms.
- Status tracking: The model supports tracking the status of a bill, including draft, submitted, partially paid, paid, overdue, void, or unknown, for better bill management and reporting.
- Relationship with other data models: The model allows for the inclusion of associated line items, bill payments, and purchase orders, providing a complete picture of each bill.
- Currency conversion: The `currency_rate` property allows for easy currency conversion between the payment currency and the base currency, ensuring accurate financial reporting and analysis.
