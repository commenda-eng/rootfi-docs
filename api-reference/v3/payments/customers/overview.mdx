**The Customer Data Model** simplifies the handling and retrieval of customer-related information across various payments platforms.

- Unified customer properties: The model unifies essential customer details, such as name, customer person, currency, and tax number, enabling easier access and management of customer data from different platforms.
- Comprehensive customer information: Customer can include associated data like phone numbers, addresses, and external links for a more detailed representation of each customer.
- Status tracking: The model supports tracking the status of each customer, with values like `ACTIVE`, `ARCHIVED`, and `UNKNOWN`, facilitating better organisation and reporting.
