- Comprehensive customer information: Customer can include associated data like phone numbers, addresses, and external links for a more detailed representation of each customer.
- Status tracking: The model supports tracking the status of each customer, with values like `ACTIVE`, `ARCHIVED`, and `UNKNOWN`, facilitating better organisation and reporting.
