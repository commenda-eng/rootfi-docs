An **invite link** contains API requests for generating and managing invite links, which can be used to connect end users to their preferred accounting platforms.

**Company Name** is the name of your customer's company. This is the name that will be displayed in the RootFi dashboard. If left blank, your customer will be prompted to enter a company name when they connect their integration.

**Integration** is the name of the integration that you want to connect to.

**Integration Category** is the category of the integrations that you want to connect to.
