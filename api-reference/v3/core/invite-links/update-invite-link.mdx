An **invite link** contains API requests for generating and managing invite links, which can be used to connect end users to their preferred accounting platforms.

Authentication and Permissions:
- A valid API key with `write` permissions is required for this endpoint.
- Only users with `invite_link.update` permission can modify invite links.

You can update the invite link if you need to:

1. Change the company name.
2. Update the sync config for this company (includes specific scopes, custom fields or sync frequency).
