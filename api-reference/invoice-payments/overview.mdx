**The Invoice Payments Data Model** streamlines the representation and management of invoice payment information across multiple accounting platforms.

- Unified payment properties: The model consolidates essential payment details, such as amount, currency, payment date, and payment mode, simplifying the handling of payment data from different platforms.
- Linked to contacts, accounts, and invoices: Each payment entry is connected to a specific [contact](/docs/contacts), [account](/docs/accounts), and [invoice](/docs/invoices) using their respective platform IDs, ensuring accurate data representation and easier cross-referencing.
- Currency rate conversion support: The `currency_rate` property enables the tracking of currency conversion rates between the payment currency and the base currency, facilitating accurate financial reporting.
