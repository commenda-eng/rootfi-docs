**The Sales Orders Data Model** standardises information related to sales orders across various accounting platforms, making it simpler to manage and access relevant data.

- Unified sales order properties: The model consolidates essential sales order information, such as contact ID, document number, dates, description, payment mode, and currency-related data.
- Financial calculations: The model includes properties for total discount, tax amount, sub-total, and total amount, facilitating accurate financial reporting and analysis.
- Invoice associations: The `invoices` property links sales orders to their corresponding invoices, enabling seamless navigation and cross-referencing between the two data models.
