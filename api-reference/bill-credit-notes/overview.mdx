**The Bill Credit Notes Data Model** is designed to standardise and simplify the management of credit note information across various accounting platforms.

- Unified credit note properties: The model consolidates essential credit note details, such as customer ID, document number, total amount, and currency, making it easier to work with credit note data from different platforms.
- Detailed status tracking: The model supports various credit note statuses, including draft, submitted, partially paid, paid, overdue, void, and unknown, for better organisation and reporting.
- Line item integration: Credit notes can include an array of associated line items, ensuring comprehensive representation of credit note details and relationships to other data models.
