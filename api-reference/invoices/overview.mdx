**The Invoices Data Model** is designed to standardise and simplify the handling of invoice-related information across different accounting platforms.

- Unified invoice properties: The model consolidates essential invoice details, such as document number, due date, currency, status, and total amounts, making it easier to manage invoice data from various platforms.
- Linked entities: Invoices can be associated with accounts, customers, line items, payments, and sales orders, providing a complete view of the invoicing process and related transactions.
- Flexible status tracking: The model supports a range of invoice statuses, such as draft, submitted, partially paid, and overdue, for better organisation and reporting.
