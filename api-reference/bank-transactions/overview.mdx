**The Bank Transactions Data Model** simplifies the management and retrieval of transaction information across different accounting platforms.

- Unified transaction properties: The model consolidates essential transaction details such as transaction date, amount, type, and status, making it easier to work with transaction data from various platforms.
- Linked account and customer data: Transactions are associated with specific accounts and customers through the `account_id` and `customer_id` properties, facilitating easier tracking and reporting.
- Currency support and exchange rates: The data model includes the transaction currency and exchange rate, enabling accurate representation of multi-currency transactions and conversions.
