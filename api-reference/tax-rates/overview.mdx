## Tax Components

**The Tax Components Data Model** complements the Tax Rates Data Model by providing detailed information about individual components of tax rates.

- Essential component properties: The model captures important tax component details, such as name, code, and rate, making it easier to work with tax components from various platforms.
- Compounding effect tracking: The `is_compound` property indicates whether a tax component has a compounding effect on the overall tax rate, allowing for accurate tax rate calculations.
- Seamless integration with Tax Rates Data Model: Tax Components are integrated as part of the Tax Rates Data Model, ensuring a comprehensive representation of tax rate structures and relationships.
