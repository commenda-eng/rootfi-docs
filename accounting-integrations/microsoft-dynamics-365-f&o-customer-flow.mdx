## Adding OAuth Credentials to your F&O Account

These steps have to be followed by the end-user who is connecting their F&O account to RootFi.

### Part 1: Set up the F&O account to access the data.

When your customer is connecting their MSD F&O account to RootFi, they will need to enter the client credentials in their F&O dashboard to allow RootFi to access the data.

1. Login to the F&O dashboard and navigate to Microsoft Entra ID applications.
