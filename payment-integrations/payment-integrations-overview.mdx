Integration Labs is a unified API provider designed to streamline payment integrations. By simplifying the process of connecting to various payment platforms, Integration Labs helps businesses access and manage their financial data with ease.

The first step in working with Integration Labs is to connect an integration - this is the payment platform whose data you want to retrieve and manipulate through Integration Labs's unified API.

### How do I set up and enable Payment Integrations?

Before you can begin pulling data via Integration Labs, it is recommended to test the integration by signing up with the payment software provider of your choice, such as Stripe and Razorpay.

Most platforms require OAuth credentials to enable you to connect to their APIs. To get started quickly you can **use Integration Labs's credentials**, which are provided in the Integration Labs dashboard. This enables you to enable an integration with a single toggle.

When moving to production we recommend you get up your own OAuth credentials. We have compiled detailed information on how to get set up with all the platforms we support.
