## Introduction

Integration Labs allows you to push merchants' data from your e-commerce or point-of-sale (POS) platform into your merchant's accounting platform. Your merchants can seamlessly reconcile their transaction data into their accounting software, allowing them to spend more time growing their business.

This workflow can be used for the following types of Companies:

- POS
- Vertical SaaS
- Payments Companies
- E-Commerce Companies

---

## Overview

Integration Labs APIs enable you to handle all the common workflows required to automate your business customers' payment data from your POS/e-commerce solution.

Through Integration Labs, your merchant can choose to reflect their sales data from e-commerce and point-of-sale (POS) software:

- As an aggregated daily/weekly **sales invoice**, or
- As an aggregated daily/weekly **journal entry**

Integration Labs recommends using **journal entries** due to the following advantages:

- **Ease of use:** Single daily journal entries are easier to manage, adjust, and reconcile than, for example, invoices, payments, and credit notes.
- **Controlled impact on the general ledger:** A journal entry is the most granular way to impact a company's general ledger without being confined to specific account types.
- **Platform API Coverage:** Journal Entries are the most widely supported data model across all accounting platforms. Other Data Models, such as Invoice Payments, Expenses, and Credit Notes, may not be available.

## Getting Started

Here's a summary of the steps involved to get started:

1. **Accounting Platform selection:** Use Integration Labs' Auth Flow to connect a business customer's accounting system.
2. **Merchant Configuration:** Once the Merchant provides access to the accounting platform, the merchant must set how the synchronization should work. This will tell you how the data should be mapped to the accounting platform.

Embed the invite link to the Integration Labs SDK into your application. Your customers will be guided through our white-labelled UI to connect their respective Accounting Platforms. A **company_id** will be generated, which can be used to read and write data for this specific connection.

Please refer to our documentation on how to integrate our SDK.

<Step title="Merchant Configuration" titleSize="h2" stepNumber="2">

This section provides guidelines for data mapping configuration from a POS/commerce platform to the supported accounting platforms (Netsuite, Xero, QuickBooks online).

In Integration Labs' POS workflow, the data types are grouped under four main features:

- Sales
- Fees
- Taxes
- Payments

**You will need to create a UI for this step.**

Request your Merchant to Map the following features to the respective General Ledger accounts from their accounting platform:

**Sales Account Mapping**

1. Sales (Revenue/Income Account)
2. Refunds (Revenue/Income Account)
3. Gratuity/Tips (Liability)
4. Prepaid Cards (Liability Account)

**Payment Fees Account Mapping**

1. Processing Fees (Platform Fee/ Expense Account)
2. Processing Fees Refund (Platform Fee Refund/ Expense Account)

**Tax Account Mapping (Optional)**

**Payment Account Mapping**

- Card (Accounts receivable)
- Cash (Cash/Bank)
- Payouts (accounts receivable)

To get the General Ledger Account Names and IDs:

1. Use the **GET/Accounts APIs** to get the **Account ID and Name** if the account already exists in the customer's accounting platform.
2. Use the **POST/Accounts APIs** to create a GL account if it does not exist

<Note> Store this mapping internally to post Journal Entries accurately. </Note>

## Posting Aggregated Daily/Weekly Journal Entries

A Journal Entry can be mapped to any General Ledger Account.

1. Use the [**POST/journal_entries**]() Data Model to create a journal entry in your Merchants Accounting Platform.
2. Use the Account IDs Mapped above to push Journal Entries to their respective Accounts.

### Example: Daily aggregated sales journal entry

This example journal entry covers a sales total of $ 1000, tax total of $ 200, gratuities of $ 50, and payment processing fee of $ 50. And A payout from the POS company.

| Accounts | Account Type | Debit | Credit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accounts Receivable | Asset | $1,200 |  |
| Revenue/Sales | Income |  | $1,000 |
| Gratuities | Income or Liability |  | $50 |
| Sales Tax | Liability |  | $200 |
| Processing Fee | Expense | $50 |  |

| Accounts | Account Type | Debit | Credit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accounts Receivable | Asset |  | $1200 |
| Bank Account | Asset | $1200 |  |

---

## Posting Sales Invoice Method

Sales are booked on a nominal account of the type **Income**. This is the account that the merchant would typically use to book their sales.

The merchant can select an existing account from the accounting platform. If an account is unavailable, it must be created in the accounting platform for this purpose.

1. Integration Labs pushes a single sales invoice to the Accounting platform daily. This invoice represents all sales made over that day.
    - The invoice is issued to the commerce services provider.
    - The invoice contains one line item for each tax rate the merchant trades in, with this line item representing the total of all sales at that tax rate.
2. When the merchant receives payment for the reported sales, the invoice is marked as paid and balanced against an invoice payment.
