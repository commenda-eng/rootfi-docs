## Introduction

Accounting integrations are crucial for bridging the gap between your AP automation solution and your customers' accounting software. This guide outlines how to leverage accounting integrations through Integration Labs' Unified Accounting API, facilitating the development of an end-to-end automated AP product.

## What is the Accounts Payable (AP) Workflow?


1. **Bill Collection**: Capture and log bills received from suppliers.
2. **Bill Verification**: Validate bill details against purchase orders.
3. **Execute Approval**: Route bills for approval based on predefined workflows.
4. **Payment Processing**: Execute payment to suppliers upon approval.
5. **Reconciliation**: Match bills and bill payments with transactions in accounting systems.

Integration with accounting systems is essential to automate these steps, particularly for reconciliation, ensuring transactions are accurately recorded in your customers accounting software.

## The Role of Accounting Integrations and Integration Labs' Unified Accounting API

While essential, developing and maintaining multiple accounting integrations in-house is resource-intensive. Integration Labs' Unified API simplifies this process by providing a single API to connect with over 20 accounting platforms.

The benefits of a Unified API include:

- **Global Connectivity**: Simplifies integration with multiple accounting platforms, ensuring maximum coverage for current and future customers.
- **Accelerated Go-to-Market**: Integrating with one Unified API significantly reduces the time required to build, test, and launch an integrated product.
- **Cost Savings**: Lowers the overall cost of developing and maintaining integrations, allowing resources to focus on core product development.
- **Maintenance Ease**: Offloads integration maintenance responsibilities, enabling your team to focus on core product enhancement.

Adopting Integration Labs' Unified API speeds up the development process and adds significant value to your Accounts Payable (AP) solution, making it more reliable and easier to integrate with customers' preferred accounting systems.

4. Create and Link Bill Payments, Purchase Orders, Good Reciept Notes, Bill Credit Notes, Contacts and Open Bills.

<Step title="Connect with your customers' accounting platform (One-Time Activity)" titleSize="h2" stepNumber="1">

Integration Labs provides two convenient options to connect with your customers' accounting platform:

1. Use Integration Labs' **Connect Link**, a convenient and secure URL, or
2. Embed Integration Labs' **Connect SDK** into your application

The Invite Link requires no code, making it suitable to start without a developer. You can customize and white-label this onboarding process with Integration Labs' Connect SDK, allowing authentication to occur natively in your product. Either way, your customers will be guided through a simple authorization flow to connect their accounting platforms to your product.

1. Use our Dashboard or APIs to connect a customer's accounting platform. Use the [**POST/invite-link**]() API, and provide a name for your customers' company.
2. A unique '**company_id**' will be generated once your customer completes the authentication flow. This '**company_id**' will be used to read and write data to their accounting platform.

<Step title="Create a Bill (Recurring)" titleSize="h2" stepNumber="2">

Use [**POST/bills**]() to create bills.

Important points to note:

1. **Contacts**: This is the vendor linked to the Bill. Use [**GET/contacts**]() and [**POST/contacts**](). A Contact ID is required to post a Bill, so if the contact doesn't exist on the accounting platform, create a new vendor using [**POST/contacts**]().
2. **Expense Account or Debited Account**: You can push multiple line items (usually just 1) when pushing an bill. Each line item will have an expense account associated (category = 'Expense'). [**GET/accounts**]() lets you fetch all accounts, and you can filter the account type by **category = "expense"**.
3. **Purchase Order**: Most companies usually issue Purchase Orders before a bill is generated. The purchase order ID can be passed in [**POST/bills**]() to link the purchase order and bill.
4. **Credit Account** (Not Required): When you use [**POST/bills**](), bills are automatically placed under the Account - **category = 'liability'** and **account_type = 'accounts_payable'**.

</Step>

<Step title="Upload Documents (Recurring)" titleSize="h2" stepNumber="3">

**POST/documents** lets you upload a file to an expense, invoice, or bill. When posting a document you will be required to pass the feild **document_type_id**, which represents the **platform_id** that will be returned after you create a bill. 

---

</Step>

<Step title="Link Bill Payment and Credit Notes" titleSize="h2" stepNumber="4">

A Bill Payment credits an account that serves as the source of funds for the payment (Credit card or Bank).

1. Use [**POST/bill_payments**]() to create and link bill payments.

The bill credit note can be created and immediately applied to a bill, or it can be created and left unapplied.

1. Use [**POST/bill_credit_note**]() to create a Bill Credit note, which can be linked to a Vendor.
