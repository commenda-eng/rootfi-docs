## Introduction

Automation transforms how your Accounts Receivable (AR) product helps your business customers generate, track, and collect payments for invoices. However, the challenge lies in seamlessly reconciling these invoices with the range of accounting platforms used by various customers.

Accounting integrations play a pivotal role in bridging your automated Accounts Receivable (AR) solution with your customers' accounting systems. This document is a step-by-step guide that details the process of using accounting integrations (via Integration Labs' Unified Accounting API) to develop an automated Accounts Receivable (AR) product with reconciliation.

## What is the Accounts Receivable (AR) Workflow?

Automating the AR workflow involves the following key steps:

1. **Invoice Generation**: Automatically create and send invoices based on services rendered or products sold.
2. **Payment Tracking**: Monitor incoming payments and match them against outstanding invoices.
3. **Reminders and Collections**: Send automated reminders for overdue invoices and manage collections for delinquent accounts.
4. **Reconciliation**: Ensure payments are accurately reflected in the accounting system.

Integrating with accounting systems is vital for automating these processes, ensuring that both invoices and payments are processed and reconciled accurately.

<Step title="Connect with your customers' accounting platform (One-Time Activity)" titleSize="h2" stepNumber="1">

Integration Labs provides two convenient options to connect with your customers’ accounting platform:

Use Integration Labs’ Connect Link, a convenient and secure URL, or
Embed Integration Labs’ Connect SDK into your application
The Invite Link requires no code to use, making it suitable to get started without a developer. You can customize and white-label this onboarding process with Integration Labs’ Connect SDK, allowing authentication to occur natively in your product.

Either way, your customers will be guided through a simple authorization flow to connect their respective accounting platforms to your product.

Use our Dashboard or APIs to connect a customer’s accounting platform a. Use the POST/invite-link. b. Name your customers’ company.
A unique `company_id` will be generated once your customer completes the authentication flow. This `company_id` will be used to read and write data to their accounting platform.

<Step title="Create Invoices" titleSize="h2" stepNumber="2">

**POST/invoice** to create an invoice.

Important points to note:

1. **Customer**: This is the customer linked to the Invoice. Use [**GET/contacts**]() or [**POST/contacts**](). A Contact ID is required to post an Invoice, so if the customer doesn't exist on the accounting platform, you'll first have to create a new customer using the [**POST/contacts**]().
2. **Items**: Every invoice contains multiple items (either goods or services) that were sold as part of the invoice, each of which credits certain accounts depending on what comprises their cost of goods sold. [**GET/items**]() lets you fetch all items in the business entity's catalogue.
3. **Sales/Purchase Order**: Most companies usually issue Sales or Purchase Orders before an Invoice is generated. Use [**GET/sales_orders**]() to get the Sales order ID, which can be passed in [**POST/invoices**]() to link the purchase order and bill.
4. **Credit Account** (Not Required): When you use the [**POST/invoices**](), invoices are automatically placed under the Account - Category= 'asset' and account_type= 'accounts_receivable'.

**POST/documents** lets you upload a file to an expense, invoice, or bill.

</Step>

<Step title="(Recurring): Link Invoice Payment and Credit Notes" titleSize="h2" stepNumber="4">

An Invoice Payment debits an accounts receivable account and credits an asset account.

1. Use [**POST/invoice_payments**]() to create and link Invoice payments.

The Invoice credit note can be created and immediately applied to a bill, or it can be created and left unapplied.

1. An Invoice credit note can be created using the [**POST/invoice_credit_note**]() and is linked to a Customer.
