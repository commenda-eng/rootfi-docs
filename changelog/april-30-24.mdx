## Improved Oracle NetSuite Bundle

Our Oracle NetSuite integration has received significant upgrades:

- Persistent Authentication: Our bundle now features an authentication mechanism that does not expire, ensuring continuous, uninterrupted access.

- Enhanced Sync Speed: We have increased the sync speed by 50 times, dramatically reducing data transfer times.


## Other Changes:
A new field, **platform_unique_id**, has been introduced. This unique identifier, generated by the underlying platform, aids in distinguishing individual records. For example, if one payment settles two invoices, while the payment itself might have a platform_unique_id of 1, Integration Labs will generate distinct platform_id for each invoice payment, such as 20_1 and 21_1.
