## Webhooks 2.0
With Webhooks 2.0, you can now receive real-time notifications when a company is linked to your account, as well as notifications when the data sync process is complete. These improvements ensure that you stay up-to-date and take immediate action if needed.

## New Data Model:
- **Tracking Categories:**
The Tracking Categories Data Model allows you to track financial transactions or expenses separately (i.e. class, location etc.) This allows you to provide your customers with greater insight into their business performance.

## Other Changes
- **Revamped Documentation:** We have overhauled our documentation to provide you with a more user-friendly and comprehensive resource. The revamped documentation includes detailed guides, tutorials, and examples, making it easier than ever to utilise our platform's features.

- **Redesigned Logo**: In our commitment to solving your problems, our redesigned logo reflects our evolution as a company while reaffirming our focus on delivering exceptional solutions.

- **New Pricing Plans**: To assist companies of all sizes to start testing and integrating, we have introduced new pricing plans. These plans are designed to meet different needs and budgets, enabling businesses of all sizes to access our platform's full potential.

- **Added Data Coverage Tool**: This tool allows users to easily view the supported data models, fields, and line items for more than 10 accounting integrations.
