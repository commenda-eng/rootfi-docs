## Sneak Peak into new categories

We have been hard at work over the last 2 months rewriting our code base with all our learnings over the past year. We are excited to share a sneak peak into our new categories. We will soon be launching unified API integrations in the following categories: E-commerce, Payments and CRM!

If you are interested in being an early adopter, please reach out to us from the chat widget on our [website](https://rootfi.dev) or email us at [contactus@rootfi.in](mailto:contactus@rootfi.in)

## Scopes

We now support OAuth scopes for our integrations. This means we will only request permissions with limited access to your customers data.
