## New Integration: Odoo
We're excited to announce our integration with Odoo, an open-source accounting platform that caters to over 7 million businesses across the globe.

## New Data Models: Financial statements
- Income Statement

- Balance Sheet

- Cash Flow Statements

## Tally Integration Improvements
- We've made several improvements to our Tally integration, including the ability to initialise sync and configure auto-sync directly from the RootFi Dashboard.

- We've also optimised the integration to handle large amounts of data. This allows for faster syncing and using Tally in the background during syncs.

## Data model changes
- We've added the Quantity On Hand field to our Items data model to support inventory use cases better. This allows you to track inventory quantities for Items across all integrated accounting platforms.

- Additionally, we've added read-and-write support for Tax Rates for Quickbooks. With this change, you can create invoices with custom tax rates.

## Other changes
- Last, but not least, we've redesigned our website landing page to provide a better user experience.
